This GitHub repository contains the assignment for the Computational Neuroscience(INFR11144) at the University of Edinburgh.

This project explores feedforward and recurrent mechanisms for orientation selectivity in the visual cortex.
3 different visual cortex mechanisms were simulated and plotted using Python.

Please find the report "VisualSystemsReport.pdf" to uncover the findings of the simulation, and "analysis.py" to see the program behind the analysis.
